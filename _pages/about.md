Hi, I am Shan! I am a 1st year Ph.D. student working with [Geoffrey Herman](http://publish.illinois.edu/glherman/). I am interested in how to use software tools to **interact** with students to improve **computer science education**. In addition, I also focus on the evaluation of students’ performance mainly **quantitatively**.

I am current working on [MeetingMayhem](https://github.com/UMBC-MeetingMayhem/MeetingMayhem), an **cybersecurity** education game to teach students Dolev–Yao model and adversary thinking. I've been working on various educational **data analysis** projects through quantitive techniques like *Item Response Theory (IRT)* , *Classical Test Theory (CTT)* , *Linear Regression*, and *High-Level Modeling (HLM)*.

In the future, I hope to work on combining AI with education tools to promote **automation** and **personalization** in CS education.
