Hi, I am Shan! I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student working with Geoffrey Herman. I am interested in how to **use education games** to interact with students to improve computer science education. In addition, I also focus on the evaluation of students’ performance mainly **quantitatively**.

I am currently working on using **educational games** to help students learn **cybersecurity**. Previously, I created **MeetingMayhem**, a cybersecurity education game to teach students the **Dolev–Yao model** and **adversarial thinking**. I’ve been working on various educational **data analysis** projects through quantitative techniques like **Item Response Theory (IRT) , Classical Test Theory (CTT) , Linear Regression, and High-Level Modeling (HLM)**.

In the future, I hope to work on combining **AI** with education tools to promote **automation and personalization** in CS education.
