abstract = {We present a psychometric evaluation of the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA), completed by 193 students from seven colleges and universities. The CCA builds on our prior work developing and validating a Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI), which measures students' conceptual understanding of cybersecurity after a first course in the area. The CCA deepens the conceptual complexity and technical depth expectations, assessing conceptual knowledge of students who had completed multiple courses in cybersecurity. We review our development of the CCA and present our evaluation of the instrument using Classical Test Theory and Item-Response Theory. The CCA is a difficult assessment, providing reliable measurements of student knowledge and deeper information about high-performing students.},
